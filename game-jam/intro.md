This dungeon is slightly antithetical to Mausritter adventure design. There are fewer specific locations than most & there is no map besides the one you make. It is also extremely lethal depending on how it's run. Fewer combat encounters are included due to the sheer number of dungeon turns that will be spent in the tunnels. The ones that do exist are extremely lethal due to the environment. Combat is best avoided if possible.

Honestly, it's a subterranean travel network masquerading as a dungeon. It's also an introduction to a darker, more dangerous, but very lucrative underworld, in addition to being a jumping point for other adventures. Your players may listen to the warning & never go past the 2nd or 3rd area as there are many paths away from this dungeon (more than there are forward). That's okay, it's actually almost intentional. There is rumored to be great reward buried just beyond their reach, but as tempting as they might be, some things are best left buried.
