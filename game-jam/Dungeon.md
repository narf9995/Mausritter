# Game Jam Submissions
## One Page Dungeon
### Area 0
Located in a stone hallway of an unrelated dungeon the entrance to Area #1 is a unassuming crack in the dungeon floor that reveals a small natural cave carved out by water.
- The crack **takes up half the hall**, but is **easily passable** without risk.
- **Traversing** the crack **requires special equipment** or a clever solution **on ascension**.
- A **crude warning symbol** is constructed outside with **”Best Left Buried, RIP My Love." written in chalk**.


### Area 1
A 24"³ cave filled with a pool of water that has a **narrow ledge along the outskirts**.

Entrances/Exits:
- **crack** in the ceiling
- two 12" wide **caved-in tunnels** on the east & west walls that appear intentional.
- 4d3 interconnected **underwater tunnels** accessible via the pool that wind off in many directions. 

#### Inhabitant
A **Swimming Centipede** has made this cave it's hunting den.

While in Area #2:
- It **retains full movement**
- It's **attacks are not impaired** by the terrain.

##### Tactics:
Prefers solo prey & will only attack offensively if it has the advantage.
- If the players are **moving recklessly** down the hallway it **attempts to silently snatch the last one** in marching order, attempting to drown them under the water in it's cave. **Otherwise, it remains hidden** until it has an opportunity.
- **If injured, it retreats** into the underwater tunnels of Area #2 in attempt to fight it's attackers one-on-one in it's home terrain.
- **If prey is subdued**, it **takes them to it's nest** in Area #2 for later consumption.

##### Weakness:
The **Centipede** has adapted to the dark. It **avoids standard light sources** to telegraph this weakness.
- A non-standard light source will blind it (ie. a Light spell), making all it's attacks **impaired** & all attacks against it **enhanced** until it can escape the light for 1 round.

##### Treasure:
- In the pool there is an **underwater lantern** & a mouse corpse reaching out towards **2 Breathing Straws** (magical tubes that contain air).
- Additionally, in Area #2, a small semi-submerged nest of rubble, corpses, & refuse the centipede uses as it's home contains:
  -  3 recent corpses: 2 mice & 1 frog.
  - Their belongings include:
    - a **cryptic treasure map**
    - a **string of pearls** (2 slots, 1500p)
    - a **Breathing Straw**.
    - Everything else is too ruined or heavy to be worth salvaging.
  - 1 living mouse survivor in possession of 2  Breathing Straws & 2 mundane items:
    - They are **poisoned** & badly wounded. **If treated** by the party, **they will join them** for the rest of this dungeon. Gifting 1 Breathing Straw as a reward, while using the other until returned to safety
    - **If untreated** they will firmly request an **immediate return to safety**, giving the party both Breathing Straws as a reward.
    - **Refusing to help** results in them trying to escape on their own: there is a **4-in-6 chance they die** & a **2-in-6 chance the corpse is discovered** in the tunnels upon egress.


### Area 2
There are 4d3+2 interconnected underwater tunnels the players can fit through (with countless number of cracks & crevices branching off that are too small for a *mouse* to fit through).
There are also tunnels larger than mouse-size, but their currents are too powerful & will contain larger, deadlier creatures.

- **Some tunnels are deadends**, while **others go off for miles** into distant areas of the greater megadungeon complex. The scale of this tunnel system is **nigh incomprehensible to mice**. 
- These tunnels are just **barely large enough for single-file traffic** & are considered a "squeeze" in caving terms.
  - This **reduces all movement by half** & **all attacks are Impaired** unless stated otherwise.
  - **Pulling/pushing additional items** is almost impossible & makes all **attacks against you enhanced**.
- The water is very murky, so **light range is diminished by half**. Significantly disturbing the muddy silt reduces light range to one's immediate surroundings (ie. paw distance).


#### Construction
To map them for reference, you can take a sheet of rectangular paper, position it sideways, & then roll 4d3+2 onto the paper to determine the exact number of tunnels & the location of the major exits (you may also choose their location if you prefer).
If there are 10+ tunnels, then there is an additional major exit that leads directly to Area #5 (Fully bypassing the threats in both Area #3 & #4). 

Mark where the dice landed with small squares.
These are the exits.
Draw a small circle on the left side of the sheet.
This is the pool.
Connect each of those squares with the circle from the left side by drawing a line between them without letting any of those lines cross.
Keep in mind that they shouldn't be straight, make the lines wiggle & meander a little. Just like a winding river.
 
These are the 4 major exits to this sprawling tunnel system (each costs 2 successful Exploration rolls to find):
- #1 is the passage to Area #3.
- #2 is the centipede den w/ it's treasure & 1 survivor. 
- #3 is a passage to another dungeon with a water feature.
- #4 is fast moving river that leads to a underground waterfall, plummeting into a deep, dark chasm. Falling into the chasm after failing more than one save causes a 2-in-6 Luck check. Failure results in death (or other equally serious consequences). On a success, the players survive the fall & awake on the rocky shore of a massive underground lake. They each lose 1d6 items at random. 
  - If the GM desires, the players now find themselves in *The Veins* with no clue how they got there.
  - Refer to *Bernpyle #6* for more *Veins of the Earth* content using *Mausritter*.
- (conditional) If there are 10+ tunnels, then there is an additional exit labeled #5 that leads directly to Area #5

Assign those exit numbers to the squares in whatever order makes sense or seems fun.

The remainder of the tunnels loop & wind around, intersecting with those 4 important tunnels, eachother, & even themselves to form a sprawling, maze-like tunnel network.

For each remaining tunnel roll 1d6 & 1d2.
The 1d6 is the number of times that tunnel crosses another tunnel (including itself).
While the 1d2 roll determines if the tunnel terminates in a deadend or an exit; 1 is a deadend, 2 is an exit.
The exits leave the edge of the page on the 4 cardinal directions, starting with North & going clockwise.
Once each cardinal direction has an exit, place the rest wherever makes sense or seems fun.
All of these exits continue off to other dungeons in the megadungeon complex.

Finally draw 1d4 large tunnels (make a thick line) that cross the entire map from one edge of the paper to the other.
Draw them slightly straighter than the previous tunnels.
These are high current & extremely deadly tunnels that are used by larger creatures.
They are not navigable by mice without a "vessel".


#### Exploration
Unless the group wishes to explore the tunnels by making highly specific "real-time" choices about which route to take, it is recommended that you use the Exploration Table to simulate the difficulties of exploration without all of the fiddly details.
If they want to explore manually, then each intersection they cross counts as 1 dungeon turn. 

1. Ask the players what they are looking for. This is their target location. Unless it's particularly easy/hard to find, this typically costs 2 successful Exploration Rolls. 
2. Have players **elect one PC** as the guide. They must be first in marching order.
3. The guide rolls 1d20 and compares it against their stats in the order shown in Table 1-1.
   - **Critical Failure** results in the secondary effects also occuring.
   - **Critical Success** means their target is discovered immediately & doesn't cost any time or advance any clocks.
5. If the **STR test is passed** then no other failure in the list counts. If the **STR test is failed** then every failure in the list counts. If the **WIL save is failed**, the Secondary Effect of every failure also occurs.
6. If a group can go neither forward nor back (or have become lost), they must explore in real time to regroup or find their way out. If a single member is separated they have to make an exploration roll with the rest of the group as their target location.
7. The time taken to find something interesting depends on the number of failures. Refer to Table 1-2
8. Once this is resolved the group is finds the thing they were looking for if they have accumulated enough successes. If they still need more successes to find it, then they find something else interesting. Roll on Table 1-3 to determine what.

### Area 3
The underwater tunnels open up into a small stone hallway with large stone door that is both locked & barricaded. Beyond the door is a 48”³ carved stone room that is filled with fungal growths & 7 very decayed corpses. On the opposite side of the room there is another locked & barricaded stone door leading to Area #4 that is slightly larger than the first.

Fungi has fully permeated every corpse:
- 2 hudled against the door, appearing to have been attempting escape before their demise as evidenced by scratch marks on the rubble.
- 4 immobile & so overgrown with bulbous fungi nodes that it's almost impossible to tell what kind of creatures they once were. Disturbing them results in an explosion of fungal spores that contaminates the entire room, triggering a STR save for everyone present. Breathing this air also triggers a STR save. Failure results in contracting Mucormycosis.
- When sound/light enters the room the last one begins to stumble around on two feet, blindly clawing at any noises it hears. 

### Area 4
This is a 96”³ ornately-carved stone room with an absolutely massive stone door leading to Area #5 on the opposite side of the room.

This room full of 16 mice... not corpses, but not quite alive either.
- 5 slowly writhing across the floor in some form of crude & offensive locomotion.
- 5 appear to be hibernating along the outskirts of the room & will awaken in the 3rd round after the room is disturbed.
- The last 6 are standing on two legs:
  - 4 overgrown with fungi nodes, but remain mobile.
  - 2 click & screech loudly, commanding the others.

### Area 5
A 192"³ ornately-carved stone room. The high ceiling, ornate pillars, & massive arches even make larger creatures feel small.
This is one of the larger treasure rooms built by the mad mouse king.
It was initially a cathedral, hence the grand scale of the construction.
Though as his greed & paranoia grew, the mad king began to think the gods themselves were after him, so he ceased all religious services & converted it into yet another treasure room where he could hoard his offensive amounts of wealth.

There are more riches here than one could reasonably list. There are ~2,000,000 pips worth of goods, art, weapons, precious metals, human trinkets, etc.
Basically at least one of anything your players could want is here.
The issue is that most of the highly valuable items are extremely large & heavy.
Only ~500,000 pips worth of goods can fit through the underwater tunnels which are the only entrance to this room that are currently accessible. 

The rest is too heavy/large.
The caved-in tunnels in Area #1 or a similarly sized passage would need to be fully cleared in order for it to be extracted.
Even after that it would still require a very large team & specialist equipment.
Also, no-one knows what's on the other side of those tunnels yet...

### Encounter Table
To reinforce the interconnected, maze-like nature of this dungeon there is just one large 1d20 Encounter Table with some optional supplemental tables.
It is weighted with "positive" results towards 1 & "negative" results towards 20.
None are good, some are just worse.

If a result comes up more than once, instead of adding duplicates, you may opt to escalate or renew the previous encounter.
Example: Perhaps the creature they first convinced to leave them alone decides it is still hungry & doubles back...

> If you want to make the tunnels more difficult, make a 1-in-6 Luck check at every intersection: success results in the players making a DEX save where failure equals an additional roll on the Encounter Table.

1d20 | Result
:---:|:---:
1 | The Ghost (w/ Entrap) of a deceased mouse in Area #4 wishes to have it's body finally put to rest. It will posses a player to communicate this if necessary. If the players ask prying questions then one party member needs to make a WIL save. Success results in Ghost explaining the event that caused the cave-in & elaborate on the nature of the primary threat of this dungeon. Failure leads to immediate combat as the traumatic memories overwhelm the Ghost, making it confused & enraged. It now blames the last player to speak to it for it's death. It wants revenge.
2 | A magical talking rock found buried in the muck is screaming for help. It promises great rewards if you return it to it's owner, although it refuses to tell you it's owners name due to "arcane patient privacy laws". If you don't agree to help, it yells obscenities at an impossibly loud volume 
3 | 1 Frog Knight who aims to clear this dungeon of it's unholy fungal taint. A successful WIL save means he will temporarily join the party to clear out the rest of the dungeon. Otherwise he recklessly charges off ahead & there is 2-in-6 chance he'll trigger the

18 | 1 Centipede (indifferent: frantically running from something... Roll for another Encounter.)
19 | Right before an intersection, the tunnel is fully blocked by 1d4 Bloated Fungal Mouse Zombies. Even if dispatched, the corpses will still obstruct the path. The players can push & dig through the blockage of vicera, making WIL save. On failure, take 1d3 WIL damage. The players can opt to make a detour around them at the cost of another Encounter check.
20 | A Faerie using a glamour to mimick the real mouse survivor in the centipede's den is screaming out in distress, but no matter how fast you move it's just slightly farther ahead in the tunnel. The longer this goes on the more frantic the voice gets. It will attempt to lead the players off the underground waterfall in Area #2, plummeting into the chasm below. If it succeeds it will return to it's Faerie form & fly besides the players as they fall, taunting them on the way down until it gets bored.

The encounter begin 1d6 x 12" away from the players, headed their direction.

If you needs more details about the encounter, you can roll 2d6 on the optional Intent Table:
