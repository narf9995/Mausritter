## Intro
The title is a warning. This dungeon can potentially be very lethal, so telegraph everything well in advance. It rewards careful planning & clever ideas. Fighting every encounter may not be possible. It can appear anywhere underground with stone hallways.


## Area 0
Located in a stone hallway of an unrelated subterranean construction, the entrance to Area #1 is a large crack in the dungeon floor that reveals a small natural cave carved out by a gradually trickling stream of water.
- The crack takes up half the hall's walkway, but is easily passable without risk.
- The crack is positioned in a way that it will likely require a grappling hook, climbing gear, or a clever solution. Especially on ascent. One could also safely jump into the water below.
- A crude warning symbol has been constructed outside with the words ”Best Left Buried, RIP My Love." written in chalk nearby.


## Area 1
The cave is 15" x 15" with 10" ceiling & features a murky 12" deep pool in the center that has a 10” radius. The crack opens up in the center of the cave ceiling directly above the pool.

Entrances/Exits:
- the crack in the ceiling
- a 5" wide tunnel on the east wall that seems to have been intentionally caved in
- 4d3 interconnected underwater tunnels winding off in many directions that are accessible via the pool.

### Inhabitant
A **Swimming Centipede** has made this cave it's hunting den, preying on the other denizens of the dungeon (including any adventurers unlucky enough wander by it). In the pool & underwater tunnels it retains it's full movement & it's attacks are not impaired by the terrain.

#### Tactics:
Prefers solo prey. It will only attack offensively if it has the advantage
- If the players are moving recklessly down the hallway it will attempt to silently snatch the last one in marching order. It will then attempt to drag them under the pool of water in it's cave to drown them & store for later consumption.
- If it's cave is compromised & it is severely injured then it will retreat into one of the underwater tunnels to hide in attempt to kill it's prey one at a time in it's preferred terrain.

#### Weakness:
This Centipede has become very accustomed to the pitch dark. It will generally avoid standard light sources to telegraph this weakness to the players, but this reaction has no effect on combat.
- Light from a non-standard source (such as the Light spell or other powerful lights) will blind it, causing all attacks it makes to be impaired & all attacks against it to be enhanced until it can escape from line-of-sight for 1 round.
-  Light reflected from these sources also counts for the purposes of this effect.
- The water is very muddy & murky, so light range is already diminished by half. Significantly disturbing the silt reduces that to only the immediate surroundings of the light source (ie. paw distance).

#### Treasure:
- At the bottom of the pool there is a mouse corpse that is reaching out towards two Breathing Straws (magical tubes that always contains air) sticking out of the silt.
- Additionally, one of the underwater tunnels that make up Area #2 terminates in an small semi-submerged nest of rubble, corpses, & refuse that the centipede uses as it's home. Among this mess is:
  -  all the belongings of 3 recently deceased victims: 2 mice & 1 frog. This includes a cryptic treasure map, a string of pearls (2 slots, 1500p), & another Breathing Straw. Everything else is too ruined and/or heavy to be worth salvaging.
  - There is also one living mouse survivor in possession of 2 more Breathing Straws:
    - They are poisoned, but will survive even without immediate medical treatment. If they are treated by the party, they will join them for the rest of this dungeon. They will only give the party one of their Breathing Straws as a reward, using the other.
    - Otherwise they will firmly request to be returned to safety. They will give the party both of their Breathing Straws as a reward.
    - Refusing to help results in them trying to escape to safety on their own: there is a 4-in-6 chance they will die & 2-in-6 chance the party encounters their corpse while exiting the dungeon.


## Area 2

There are 4d3+2 interconnected underwater tunnels the players can fit through (in addition to a countless number of cracks & crevices branching off that are too small for a *mouse* to fit through).
- Some underwater tunnels are deadends, while others go off for miles into distant areas of the greater megadungeon complex. The scale of this tunnel system is almost incomprehensible to mice.
- These tunnels are considered a "squeeze" in caving terms & are just barely large enough for single file traffic. This reduces all movement speed by half & all combat is Impaired unless stated otherwise.


### Construction
To map them for reference, you can take a sheet of rectangular paper, position it sideways, & then roll 4d3+2 onto the paper to determine the exact number of tunnels & the location of the major exits (you may choose their location if you prefer). If there are 10+ tunnels, then there is an additional major exit that leads directly to Area #5 (Fully bypassing the threats in both Area #3 & #4).

Mark where the dice landed with small squares. These are the exits. Draw a small circle on the left side of the sheet. This is the pool. Connect each of those squares with the circle from the left side by drawing a line between them without letting any of those lines cross. Keep in mind that they shouldn't be straight, make the lines wiggle & meander a little. Just like a winding river.

These are the 4 major exits to this sprawling tunnel system:
- #1 is the passage to Area #3.
- #2 is the centipede den w/ it's treasure & 1 survivor.
- #3 is a passage to another dungeon that has a water feature.
- #4 is fast moving river that leads to a underground waterfall, plummeting into a deep, dark chasm. Falling into the chasm after failing more than one save causes a 2-in-6 Luck check. Failure results in death (or other equally serious consequences). On a success, the players survive the fall & awake on the rocky shore of a massive underground lake. They each lose 1d6 items at random.
  - If the GM desires, the players now find themselves in *The Veins* with no clue how they got there.
  - Refer to *Bernpyle #6* for more *Veins of the Earth* content using *Mausritter*.
- [Conditional] If there are 10+ tunnels, then there is an additional exit labeled #5 that leads directly to Area #5

Assign those exit numbers to the squares in whatever order makes sense or seems fun.

The remainder of the tunnels loop & wind around, intersecting with those 4 important tunnels, eachother, & even themselves to form a sprawling, maze-like tunnel network.

For each remaining tunnel roll 1d6 & 1d2. The 1d6 is the number of times that tunnel crosses another tunnel (including itself). While the 1d2 roll determines if the tunnel terminates in a deadend or an exit; 1 is a deadend, 2 is an exit. The exits leave the edge of the page on the 4 cardinal directions, starting with North & going clockwise. Once each cardinal direction has an exit, place the rest wherever makes sense or seems fun. All of these exits continue off to other dungeons in the megadungeon complex.


### Exploration
Unless the group wishes to explore the tunnels by making highly specific "real-time" choices about which route to take, it is recommended that you use the Exploration Table to simulate the difficulties of exploration without all of the fiddly details. If they want to explore manually, then each intersection they cross counts as 1 dungeon turn.

1. Ask the players what they are looking for. This is their target location.
2. Have players elect one PC as the guide. They must be first in marching order.
3. The guide rolls 1d20 and compares it against their stats in the order shown in Table 1-1. Critical Failure results in both effects occurring. Critical Success means this location is discovered immediately & the exploration doesn't cost any time or advance any clock.
4. If the STR test is passed then no other failure in the list counts. If the STR test is failed then every further failure in the list applies. If the WIL save is failed then the Secondary Effect of every failure also occurs.
5. If a group can go neither forward nor back, they must explore in real time to regroup or find their way out.
6. The time taken to find something interesting depends on the number of failures. Refer to Table 1-2
7. Once this situation is resolved the group is assumed to have either found the thing they were looking for (if it's a reasonable possibility) or something interesting. For Something Interesting, roll on the Int

## Area 3
This room is filled with fungi & 7 very decayed corpses. Fungi has fully permeated every corpse.
- 2 of which are hudled against the door, appearing to have been attempting escape before their demise as evidenced by scratch marks on the rubble.
- 4 more immobile ones are so over overgrown with bulbous fungi nodes that it's almost impossible to tell what kind of creatures they once were. Disturbing the overgrown corpses results in an explosion of fungal spores that contaminates the entire room, triggering a STR save for everyone present. Breathing in this air afterwards also triggers a STR save. Failure results in contracting Mucormycosis.
- When sound/light enters the room the last one begins to stumble around on two feet, blindly clawing at any noises it hears.

## Area 4
This room full of 16 mice... not corpses, but not quite alive either.
- 5 can be seen slowly writhing across the floor in some form of crude & offensive locomotion.
- 5 more appear to be hibernating along the outskirts of the room.
- The last 6 are standing on two legs; 4 are overgrown with bulbous fungi nodes & 2 click & screech loudly, appearing to command the others.


### Area 5

## Encounter Table
To reinforce the interconnected, maze-like nature of this dungeon there is just one large 1d20 Encounter Table with some optional supplemental tables. It is weighted with "positive" results towards 1 & "negative" results towards 20. None are good, some are just worse. If you want to make the tunnels harder, make a 1-in-6 Luck check at every interection: success results in the players making a DEX save

1d20 | Result
:---:|:---:
1 | The Ghost (w/ Entrap) of a deceased mouse in Area #4 wishes to have it's body finally put to rest. It will posses a player to communicate this if necessary. If the players ask prying questions then one needs to make a WIL save. Success results in Ghost explaining the event that caused the cave-in & elaborate on the nature of the primary threat of this dungeon. Failure leads to immediate combat as the traumatic memories overwhelm the Ghost, making it confused & enraged. It now blames the last player to speak to it for it's death & wants revenge.
2 | A magical talking rock found buried in the muck is screaming for help. It promises great rewards if you return it to it's owner, although it refuses to tell you it's owners name due to "arcane patient privacy laws". If you don't agree to help, it yells obscenities at an impossibly loud volume
3 | 1 Frog Knight who aims to clear this dungeon of "it's unholy fungal taint". A successful WIL save means he will temporarily join the party to clear out the rest of the dungeon. Otherwise he recklessly charges off ahead & there is 2-in-6 chance he'll trigger the immobile Fungi Zombies

15 | 2d4 Rival Mouse Adventurers (hostile)
17 | 1d4 Water Rat Bandits (hostile)
18 | 1 Centipede (indifferent: frantically running from something... Roll for another Encounter.)
19 | Right before an intersection, the tunnel is fully blocked by 1d4 Bloated Fungal Mouse Zombies. Even if dispatched, the corpses will still obstruct the path. The players can push & dig through the blockage of vicera, making WIL save. On failure, take 1d3 WIL damage. The players can opt to make a detour around them at the cost of another Encounter check.
20 | A Faerie using a glamour to mimick the real mouse survivor in the centipedes den is screaming out in distress, but no matter how fast you move it's just slightly farther ahead in the tunnel. The longer this goes on the more frantic the voice gets. It will attempt to lead the players off the underground waterfall, plummeting into the deep, dark chasm below. If it succeeds it will turn back into it's Faerie form & fly besides the players as they fall, taunting them on the way down until it gets bored.

The encounters begin 1d6 x 12" away from the players, headed their direction. Telegraph the encounter before contact with sounds or other sensory clues to allow the players to prepare for or even avoid the encounter.
