# Mucormycosis
## Infestation Overview

Infection usually develops within a week after exposure, but in some cases it can take up to 2 months. Without treatment, only about 5% of patients with this fungal infestation survive. Those that do are weakly, yet permanently, psychically linked to the The Mucormycete Network (a.k.a. Hive-mind) although only if within 500ft of a hive-mind node such as mycelium or another host.

However, with aggressive treatment (assisted by high-tech tools or weak magic), about 55% of patients survive. Sufficiently powerful magical treatment obviously has a 100% survival rate. 

It starts with inhalation, multiplying in the respiratory system, & proceeds to slowly take over the body, system by system. Once it spreads to the brain, the host strongly desires social interaction, eventually developing an irrational fear of isolation. They will violently attempt to escape isolation & try to find other sentient creatures to keep them company (particularly ones they are capable of speaking with with). They are only aggressive when being attacked or abandoned. It frequently spreads from the inside to the outside, but it is also believed that several victims may have began with a cutaneous form.

The hosts fever continues to rise, in an exponential rate (J-Curve), until they eventually fall into to a coma & die from the fever. At this point the infestation has has fully disseminated in the host & has visibly blackened the entire body, including the eyes & inside every office. Their nose & eyelids have rotted off in the later stages infestation.

The body lays dead for approximately 24 hours & then "raises from the dead" (non-undead), attempting to climb to the tallest object it can reach, latch on with rigor mortis, &  explode in a cloud of spores to be inhaled by new hosts. 

It's possibly magical or otherwise aberrant, but only an expert in diseases both natural & magical could discern anything specific beyond the observable symptoms & settlement's rumors.

Magical healing will heal the damage caused by the infestation, but can't stop the spread. Any magic the settlement, the surrounding settlement, & PCs have access to can only prolong death & even that would require persistent casting of the spell as the infection continues to cause damage afterwards. It would require expert level casting abilities to have magic powerful enough to cease the infestation. Nothing short of a Divine/Infernal/Otherworldly intervention could cure it otherwise.

## Infestation: Mucormycosis

Mucormycetes, the group of fungi that cause mucormycosis, are present throughout the natural environment, particularly in deep soil & in association with decaying organic matter, such as leaves, compost piles, corpses, and animal dung. They are more common in soil than in air, and in summer and fall than in winter or spring.

Most people come in contact with microscopic fungal spores of many kinds every day. Especially in a dirty lines of work or societies without sanitation standards, so it’s probably impossible as an average humanoid to completely avoid coming in contact with regular mucormycetes.

These fungi aren’t harmful to most healthy people in , so anyone with expert level knowledge of the relevant biological sciences (i.e.  Epidemiology, Humanoid Anatomy, mycology) would note the aberrance & immediate concern of this quickly accelerating epidemic. However, for people who have weak immune systems breathing in mucormycete spores can cause an infection in the lungs or sinuses which can spread to other parts of the body. This population is were the infestation will first muliplty & begin to spread it's mycelium across the settlement it's brought back to. Once established

### Symptoms of rhinocerebral (sinus and brain) mucormycosis include:
  - One-sided facial swelling.
  - Headache.
  - Nasal or sinus congestion.
  - Black lesions on nasal bridge or upper inside of mouth that quickly become more severe.
  - Fever.

### Symptoms of pulmonary (lung) mucormycosis include:
  - Fever.
  - Cough.
  - Chest pain.
  - Shortness of breath.

### Symptoms of Cutaneous (skin) mucormycosis:

Can look like blisters or ulcers, and the infected area may turn black

Other symptoms include:
  - Pain.
  - Warmth.
  - Excessive redness.
  - Swelling around the wound(s).

### Symptoms of gastrointestinal mucormycosis include:
  - Abdominal pain.
  - Nausea and vomiting
  - Gastrointestinal bleeding

### Disseminated mucormycosis:

This typically occurs in people who are already sick from other medical conditions, so it can be difficult to know which symptoms are related to mucormycosis. Patients with disseminated infection in the brain can develop mental status changes or coma.

In the case of this infestation it does both: the host desires social interaction, progressively  developing an irrational fear of isolation & eventually the host is terminated via a fever-induced coma. The hosts body is then animated & used to disseminate new spores to new hosts.

## The Mucormycete Network (a.k.a The Hive-mind)

There are 3 theorized tiers or levels to The Mucormycete Network. You can think of them like "nesting dolls" or "building blocks", each being comprised of the previous. It is unknown how many additional levels exist beyond this (& further energy spent pondering this is pointless) as observing the extra-cosmological is unattainable even to the gods as they are of this cosmos... At least according to the gods.

The ultimate goal of "The Minor Mucormycete Network" (MiMN) is absolute connectivity, a perfect network spanning the planet. This  network-of-networks forms "The Major Mucormycete Network"  (MaMN). It is extra-cosmological in origin & the ultimate goal of the MaMN to have enough bio-mass to join "The Greater Mucormycete Network" (GMN). Absolutely nothing is known about the GMN by surface dwelling  terrestrial beings in this cosmos 

Other species of fungi's mycelium can act as a tertiary communication network if the Mucormycete network has a large enough bio-mass. Although this is limited to 100ft & can only cross 2 regular mycelial networks before requiring another Mucormycete network to act as a repeater.
