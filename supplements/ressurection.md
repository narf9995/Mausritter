# Mausritter Ressurection

Ressurection creates a bond between a revived mouse and the caster who saved them. In order to bring someone back from the beyond requires the caster to sacrifice a fragment of their own soul in order to anchor the soul back to its existence.

On a successful resurrection, the anchored soul takes on a trait of the caster which may add to some cool physical changes or fun dynamics and relationships between two bonded mice.

## Spells

Each of the ressurection spells are recharged by completing a ritual that consumes it's components in the process. The cost depends on the spell. The caster must make a WIL save, failure results in the spell failing.

Besides the WIL save, they otherwise function identically to the spells present in the core *Mausritter* rulebook. 

Miracle is not a traditional spell that can be recharged. It is "cast" by making a plea while holding a holy symbol or magical object.

## Fading Spirit: Ressurection Challenge

If a mouse is dead, and a resurrection is attempted by a spell or spell effect other than True Ressurection or Miracle, a resurrection challenge is initiated. Up to 3 other mice can offer to contribute to the ritual. The GM asks them each to make a save based on their form of contribution, with each success allowing the caster an additional reroll on their WIL save.

If the subject has been ressurected previously, the caster makes WIL save with -1 to their WIL while casting. This penalty increases by -1 for each additional previous resurrection the mouse has undergone (signifying the slow erosion of the soul’s connection to this world).

- Upon a successful resurrection check, the player’s soul (should it be willing) will be returned to the body.

- On a failed check, the soul does not return and the mouse is lost.

Only the strongest of magical effects can bypass this resurrection challenge, typically in the form of the True Resurrection or Miracle spells. These can also restore a mouse to life who was lost due to a failed resurrection ritual.

## Anchored Soul: Bonded Traits

Each time a mouse is successfully resurrected from a ritual or spell, their soul is now anchored by the caster of the ritual or spell.

If the caster of the ritual dies, the vitality of all the mice resurrected by the caster starts to corrode.

For each day after the caster has died, the mouse’s STR score is decreased by the number of resurrections the mouse has had.

A mouse whose STR score is reduced to 0 in this way dies permanently and can’t be returned to life in any way short of a Miracle.

> **Example:** a mouse who has been resurrected 2 times, decreases their STR score by 2 each day the caster is dead.

An anchor can be reestablished if the original caster is resurrected. A soul can be freed of the attachment of this anchor by a wish spell. 

The establishment of an anchor is symbolized by a random trait that the resurrected mouse takes on in the likeness of the caster. The trait is determined by rolling a d10 on Table 1 below.

### Table 1: Anchored Soul Trait

1d10 | Trait
:---:|:---:
1 | You now have the same fears as the caster.
2 | A part of your body how has the same skin color and texture as the caster.
3 | A patch of your hair is now the same color as the caster.
4 | One of your eyes turns into the same eye color as the caster.
5 | You now share a psionic link with the caster and can communicate telepathically with one another.
6 | You now share an empathic link with the caster and emulate whatever strong emotion they feel.
7 | You gain knowledge of a precious memory or secret of the caster knows.
8 | You gain one random tool proficiency that the caster has.
9 | You gain one random skill proficiency that the caster has.
10 | Nothing happens.

## Other Resurrection Ideas

- You could also turn a player’s death into part of the story, such as requiring the players to retrieve the soul of the mouse, from another plane of existence.

- Limit the total number of resurrections available to your players.
